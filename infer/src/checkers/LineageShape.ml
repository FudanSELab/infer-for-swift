(** This analysis aims at inferring all the fields that may be accessed from some variable, possibly
    through aliases.

    The original goal is to be able to use that information in the lineage analysis, by making
    information flow through fields even if they appear in later instructions. The typical use-case
    is when an argument [$argN] of a function is copied into the name [X], and then the function

    [$argN#foo] at the same time as the node [$argN]. *)

    (** Given field shapes, a particular shape, a maximal width, a maximal search depth and a
        boolean indicating that cycles should not be traversed, traverses the field shapes table and
        builds the field paths obtained by recursively adding all the defined fieldnames of the
        considered shape to the prefixes.

        The traversal building a field path will stop when the maximal search depth has been
        reached, a shape with more than [max_width] fields is encountered, or a shape that has
        already been traversed is encountered and [prevent_cycles] is true.

        When the building of a field path stops, the folding function [f] will be called on the path
        built so far.

        Note that the traversal and the calling of [f] is done from the original argument shape: for
        instance, if [X] has the field [X#foo#bar#baz], the depth limit is 2 and this function is
        called from the shape of [X#foo], then [f] will be called with the field path [bar#baz] --
        even if [X#foo] and [X#bar#baz] have the same shape, or [X] has a thousand other fields.
        This is why [~max_search_depth] is labelled differently from the [~max_depth] of the other
        functions (it has a slightly different semantics).

        The typical use-case is to then have [f] call {!finalise}, with [X#foo] in the parameters,
        which will repeat a similar traversal to only yield [X#foo#bar] as a final field path. This
        allows implementing {!fold_terminal_fields_2} by first getting the candidate terminal fields
